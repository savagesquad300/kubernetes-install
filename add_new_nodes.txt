To add new worker and control plane nodes, follow the steps
- Run the kubeinstall.sh script on the new node and thus install all kubernetes components
You must enable ssh connection between and across all kubernetes nodes
- Head to the master node and run the command
$sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
run the output in the node you want to add to the cluster as a worker node.
- To join a master node, from the output of the command we got eatlier we have to add some more arguments as shown below;
--control-plane  --certificate-key <CERT_KEY>
How do you generate the certificate key??
Run the command below
$kubeadm certs certificate-key
Enjoy!!!
